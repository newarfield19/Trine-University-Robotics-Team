## Programming an Arduino Nano

The specific Arduino Nano used for this project is an Elegoo brand purchased from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Arduino-ATmega328P-Without-Compatible/dp/B0713XK923). In order to flash the Arduino, you must first install a CH340 driver that can be found online (see Useful Links below). Afterwards, you must select the 'ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)' from the Processor selection in the Arduino IDE. In addition, you must also determine which COM Port is being used by the Arduino once connected via USB Micro. If all is done correctly, the program should flash to the board without error.
